> **"Building the future of healthcare with Artificial Intelligence."**

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website. It is designed to be a high-performance, visually immersive showcase of my work as the Founder of **TechoCore** and an AI/ML Architect. The site leverages modern web technologies to create a futuristic, tech-forward user experience.

## 🌟 Key Features

The portfolio is built without heavy frameworks to ensure maximum performance and control over animations.

* **🧠 Neural Network Background:** A custom HTML5 Canvas animation using JavaScript to create a dynamic, connecting particle system representing AI nodes.
* **🧊 Glassmorphism UI:** Modern, frosted-glass aesthetic applied to cards and navigation elements using backdrop filters.
* **👀 Interactive Cursor:** A custom trailing cursor that interacts with the background elements.
* **🖥️ 3D Tilt Effects:** JavaScript-powered tilt animations on project and skill cards that react to mouse movement.
* **✨ Scroll Reveal:** Elements smoothly fade and slide in as the user scrolls down the page.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Optimized layout for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Variables, Keyframes)
* **Scripting:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Icons:** FontAwesome 6.4
* **Fonts:** 'Outfit' and 'Space Grotesk' (Google Fonts)
